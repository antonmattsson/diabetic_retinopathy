### Notes:

#### Working on the server:

Connect using ```ssh username@taito.csc.fi ```  

Use the ```$WRKDIR``` folder. The git repository is located there.

To activate Python 3, you need to run ```source ~/.bashrc_profile``` at the beginning of every session.

**Git push is not working atm!** So to change something, commit on your own machine and then pull to the server.
